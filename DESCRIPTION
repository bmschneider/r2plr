Description: When working with big data housed in a Greenplum database, there are a few 
	technical details on deploying an algorithm written in R using PL/R to Greenplum. 
	This package streamlines those logistics for the user. Furthermore, it incorporates 
	the use of knitr for analytics prototyping. First, it simplifies pulling 
	a subset piece of data in the manner in which it would be pulled once deployed. Then, 
	it compiles a R markdown document into a PL/R function and defines the necessary 
	headers / types.
